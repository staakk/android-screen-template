# Android Studio Screen Template

This is template for Android Studio which I use for creating new screens in Androird apps. It`s based on [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html) and [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) DI library. 
To use this template you should copy ```android``` folder and paste it to Android Studio directory. In repo there is also ```DaggerLifecycleFragment.java``` file which is used as base class for fragment in this template.
